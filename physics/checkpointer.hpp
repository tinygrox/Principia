// The checkpointer helps with compact serialization of timelines, i.e., classes
// that associate some data with distinct instants.  The naïve implementation of
// serialization for timelines would write all the pairs (time, data) but that
// would potentially result in large saves that would be expensive to read and
// write.
// Instead, this class creates checkpoints that encapsulate all information
// needed to reconstruct the timeline after a give point in time.  When
// serializing a timeline, the pairs (time, data) are written up to the oldest
// checkpoint, followed by the checkpoint itself.  When deserializing, the
// timeline may be reconstructed as needed based on the checkpoint.
// Checkpoints must be created at regular intervals because they are dropped by
// ForgetBefore: this ensures that there is always a sufficient old checkpoint
// available the next time serialization is performed.
// Logically checkpoints would serialize to/deserialize from a specific message,
// but for historical reasons they just fill some fields of a message that may
// contain other information.
// This class is thread-safe.
