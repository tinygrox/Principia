// The International Celestial Reference System.
// The origin is the barycentre of the solar system.  The axes are fixed with
// respect to the quasars.
// The xy plane is close to the mean equator at J2000.0.
// The x axis is close to the dynamical equinox at J2000.
// The z axis is perpendicular to the xy plane and points to the northern side
// of the xy plane.
// To be honest:
// - There are several realizations of the ICRS, namely ICRF (ICRF1) and its
//   extensions, ICRF2, and the optical Hipparcos Celestial Reference Frame
//   (HCRF); these realizations have different errors, but are consistent. ICRF3
//   is in preparation, as well as an optical realization based on Gaia data.
// - The terms Barycentric Celestial Reference System (BCRS) and ICRS are often
//   used interchangeably:
//   - the ICRS has its origin at the barycentre (IAU 1997 resolution B2; Arias
//     et al. 1995 "The extragalactic reference system of the International
//     Earth Rotation Service", IAU 1991 recommendations);
//   - the relativistic framework, including the metric
//     tensor, is defined for the BCRS (IAU 2000 resolution B1.3);
//   - the orientation of the BCRS is given by the ICRS axes unless otherwise
//     stated (IAU 2006 resolution B2 recommendation 2).
//   However, the term BCRS tends to be used in practice when the time scale
//   in use is the time coordinate of the BCRS, namely TCB.  Since Principia
//   does not support general relativity, and uses only one time scale (TT
//   identified with TCB), we call this ICRS.

// The Geocentric Celestial Reference System.
// The origin is the centre of mass of the whole Earth system, including oceans
// and atmosphere; the axes are those of the ICRS.
// To be honest:
// - The BCRS and GCRS are relativistic reference systems.
// - The transformation between BCRS and GCRS spatial coordinates has no
//   rotational component, i.e., the GCRS is kinematically non-rotating with
//   respect to the BCRS; since its origin moves in the BCRS, it follows from
//   general relativistic effects that it rotates dynamically with respect to
//   the BCRS; in particular, the equations of motion in the GCRS include de
//   Sitter and Lense–Thirring precession.
// - The time coordinate of the BCRS is TCB, and the time coordinate of the GCRS
//   is TCG; TT is a linear scaling of TCG, and TDB is a linear scaling of TCB;
//   for practical purposes TT and TDB are within 2 ms of each other;
//   Principia's |Instant| is TT.

// The International Terrestrial Reference System.
// The origin is the centre of mass of the whole Earth system, including oceans
// and atmosphere; there is no global residual rotation with respect to
// horizontal motions at the earth's surface.
// Practical notes:
// - This is identical to WGS84 at 1 m level, and to recent realizations of WGS
//   84 at 10 cm level; the xz plane is a bit over a hundred metres from the
//   Royal Observatory in Greenwich.
//   Caveat: using |SphericalCoordinates<Length>| on ITRS coordinates is
//   inconsistent with WGS 84 latitudes; the WGS 84 geoid should be used.
// - The ITRS is related to the European Terrestrial Reference System (ETRS89)
//   by a time-dependent rigid transformation.
// To be honest:
// - There are many realizations of the ITRS; as of this writing, ICRFs 89, 90,
//   91, 92, 93, 94, 96, 97, 2000, 2005, 2008, and 2014.  They are related by
//   linearly time-dependent linearized similarity transformations with nonzero
//   scaling, which the current abstractions of Principia cannot support; see
//   Transformation parameters from ITRF2014 to past ITRFs,
//   http://itrf.ensg.ign.fr/doc_ITRF/Transfo-ITRF2014_ITRFs.txt.  Identifying
//   recent ITRFs (2005 and later) results in errors of a few millimetres at the
//   geocentre, scale errors on the order of 1 part-per-billion, and angular
//   errors below 1 μas.  Identifying earlier ITRFs may result in errors of tens
//   of centimetres at the geocentre, scale errors on the order of ten parts per
//   billion, and arcsecond-level angular errors.
// - ETRFyy is always related to the corresponding ITRFyy by a linearized rigid
//   transformation depending linearly on time, however it is related to other
//   ITRFs by time-dependent similarity with time-dependent nonzero scaling; see
//   the tables in EUREF Technical Note 1,
//   http://etrs89.ensg.ign.fr/pub/EUREF-TN-1.pdf
